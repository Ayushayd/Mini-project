        <div className="container">
            <p>Welcome to the Women Welfare Community! Our community is dedicated to creating a safe and supportive
                environment for women students and faculty. Join us in our mission to empower women and promote safety on
                campus.</p>

            <h2>How We Work</h2>
            <p>We work closely with universities and the main community head to ensure campus safety. Here's how we operate:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>We invite universities to develop and endorse our community to create a safe space on campus.</li>
                <li>The university or the main community head accepts applications from interested women faculty and
                    students.</li>
                <li>We analyze the applications and form a dedicated team to conduct events and monitor the safety level of
                    the college.</li>
                <li>We find ways to improve safety and collaborate with donors, colleges, nearby communities, and government
                    authorities to support our cause with time, money, and resources.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Our Initiatives</h2>
            <p>As part of our community, you'll have the opportunity to participate in various events and sessions focused
                on women's safety and empowerment. We hold regular sessions where survivors share their stories and inspire
                others to take a stand against harassment.</p>
